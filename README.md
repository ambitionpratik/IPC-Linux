| **Pipes**               | One-way communication between related processes    |
| **FIFOs (Named Pipes)** | Like pipes but can be used by unrelated processes  |
| **Message Queues**      | Send/receive discrete messages                     |
| **Shared Memory**       | Fastest IPC; multiple processes access same memory |
| **Semaphores**          | Synchronization tool to control resource access    |
| **Sockets**             | Bidirectional IPC, even across network             |
| **Signals**             | Notify processes asynchronously of events          |
| **Memory-mapped Files** | Share memory through file mapping                  |
| **D-Bus**               | High-level IPC used in desktop applications        |
